# poll-project
To run the project, make sure to run first the database_ddl.sql and database_dml.sql files on your mysql server.
You can register to create a new user, however if you run the database_dml.sql file creates an admin user with username=admin and password=admin. 
An admin can create new elections, for users to candidate to and vote for a candidate in an election.
Users can change their own passwords, they can also candidate only once to an election and only vote once for one candidate in some election.
